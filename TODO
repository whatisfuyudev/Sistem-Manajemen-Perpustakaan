### General TODO
- do it for articles too, have gpt write an article that is copy paste-able to quill js editor

- checkout model or any other model, 
  no negative number on renewalCount or other number based column

- strech whole screen so footer does not move place on book-details page, profile, news-details, article-details

- notification maybe batch send, new endpoint?

- make sure the book service works properly, ensure data sanitization

- send email notification if checkout is overdue 

- check whether the jwt token is expired or not
- implement refresh tokens and expiration checking for main auth jwt_token (1 hour expiration time)
  - refresh tokens last for a long time, like 1 week or 1 month
- no return jwt token from login controller because bad practice?

- rate limiting on apis
- on homepage script, when the it loads and randomly picks five books, 
  limit into only picking at most 100 books for performance reason while
  maintining randomness. bonus points if it is possible to do this whole
  randomize seaching thing directly with sequilize. 

- code cleanup, 
  - css cleanup, no duplicate style
  - js cleanup, no duplicate code
  - delete any console.log/console.error on front end
  - move custom pop up into its own file so it is reuseable accross the whole app
    - change alert or prompt to custom pop up
  - user controller and books controller redundant code when removing empty input 

- implement accountStatus on user data/model, look at docs

- stress test, 1 million data is too big, test for 100k, 10k, 1k

- sequilize association between table/model

- user engagement, because it fetch two different api endpoint the data retrieved can be different. the difference in data mess up the front end. handle when there is a user with only reservation or checkouts

- maybe replace back end console.error for logger.error

- log only the important stuff

- inapp notification? consider deleting or implementing it.

- github repo readme, do it properly
