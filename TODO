### General TODO
- user engagement, because it fetch two different api endpoint the data retrieved can be different. the difference in data mess up the front end. handle when there is a user with only reservation or checkouts

- github repo readme, do it properly

- code cleanup, 
  - css cleanup, no duplicate style
  - js cleanup, no duplicate code
  - delete any console.log on front end
  - move custom pop up into its own file so it is reuseable accross the whole app
    - change alert or prompt to custom pop up

- stress test, 1 million data is too big, test for 100k, 10k, 1k

- log only the important stuff
