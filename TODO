### General TODO
- turn off rate limiting because the server host the image locally 
  instead of on some cloud platform like aws s3/firebase/etc.
  this makes the request for each user really high and will hit the rate limit
  very quickly. if rate limiter want to be turned on, consider storing images
  on firebase or s3 or some sort of free static asset hosting platform.

- code cleanup, 
  - css cleanup, no duplicate style
  - js cleanup, no duplicate code
  - delete any console.log on front end
  - move custom pop up into its own file so it is reuseable accross the whole app
    - change alert or prompt to custom pop up

- stress test, 1 million data is too big, test for 100k, 10k, 1k

- log only the important stuff
