2. make user interface, reponsive html pages
  - make the user/client side first

### General TODO
- make sure the book service works properly, ensure data sanitization
- prevent upload cover image abuse (only upload the image at the same time as clicking update book data)
- make ui html page
- make the html homepage that display all books (search up responsive design)
- at user routes, create new user is only for admin access
- make two different endpoints, one for admin/librarian, the other for client/patron/user
  - New Endpoint to get single user by their id (admin/librarian only)
  - New Endpoint to update a user by their id (admin/librarian only)

- make the correct Flow for reserving a book
  1. User is in homepage
  2. User click on book
  3. Go to individual book page with all book information and a button for reserving that book
  4. When user click that reserving book, it sends the correct and needed book data to the api
  5. A reservation is made

- make the correct flow for cancelling a reservation
  1. user is on my reservation page
  2. on each reservation there will be a button that
     when pressed, will send the reservation id to the api

- make the correct modify reservation flow
  1. user is on my reservation page
  2. user click on a reservation, redirect to individual reservation page
  3. there is a button to modify it
  4. after modifying things, there is a send button, click and it sends the data to the api

- add a search bar for checkout history and reservation history

- pagination and or limit data fetching on checkout history and reservation history
  so it does not load every single data immidiately

- implement refresh tokens and expiration checking for main auth jwt_token (1 hour expiration time)
  - refresh tokens last for a long time, like 1 week or 1 month

this app will have two sides, one for patron (book enjoyer) and one for librarians (book manager)
- patron can only make reservation to borrow books, see their profile, and see all books, search books with ui
- librarian can add books, see all books, see all patrons, see all borrowed books, see all reservations, see all fines, see all reports, manage borrowing

- checkouts is for librarian
- reservations is for user (only some of it, other endpoints is for admin/librarian)

- rate limiting on apis
