### General TODO
- schedule notification functionality or notifications functionalities in general
- make sure the book service works properly, ensure data sanitization
- checkout model no negative number on renewalCount or other number based column
- prevent upload cover image abuse (upload the image at the same time as clicking update book data)
- at user routes, create new user is only for admin access
- make two different endpoints, one for admin/librarian, the other for client/patron/user
  - New Endpoint to get single user by their id (admin/librarian only)
  - New Endpoint to update a user by their id (admin/librarian only)


- check whether the jwt token is expired or not
- implement refresh tokens and expiration checking for main auth jwt_token (1 hour expiration time)
  - refresh tokens last for a long time, like 1 week or 1 month
- no return jwt token from login controller because bad practice?

this app will have two sides, one for patron (book enjoyer) and one for librarians (book manager)
- patron can only make reservation to borrow books, see their profile, and see all books, search books with ui
- librarian can add books, see all books, see all patrons, see all borrowed books, see all reservations, see all fines, see all reports, manage borrowing

- checkouts is for librarian
- reservations is for user (only some of it, other endpoints is for admin/librarian)

- rate limiting on apis
- on homepage script, when the it loads and randomly picks five books, 
  limit into only picking at most 100 books for performance reason while
  maintining randomness. bonus points if it is possible to do this whole
  randomize seaching thing directly with sequilize. 

- more on home page like books based on author
  books based in letters
  idk ask gpt for books based on what that make sense

- code cleanup, 
  - move test search page html file into a new temporary folder or delete it
  - delete unused/test pages
  - css cleanup, no duplicate style
  - js cleanup, no duplicate code
  - delete any console.log/console.error on front end
  - move custom pop up into its own file so it is reuseable accross the whole app
    - change alert or prompt to custom pop up
  - user controller and books controller redundant code when removing empty input 

- fix margin/gap between text and things inside reservation card on myreservations page

- on homepage top bar part thing, collapse it in mobile

- new ui on my reservations and my checkouts page, modern

- implement accountStatus on user data/model, look at docs
