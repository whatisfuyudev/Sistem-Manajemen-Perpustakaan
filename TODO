2. make user interface, reponsive html pages
  - make the user/client side first
    - make it similiar to https://www.libib.com/
      - there will be homepage, individual book page, profile page, my reservations page, my checkouts page, register page, login page
        - homepage has a link to profile page, register/login page, individual book page,
          my reservation page, my checkouts page      
          - make my checkout page
            - ask gpt about renewal, does it make sense to show it to user?
              when should renewal occurs(what status)
            - on my reservations and my checkouts page, at filters classname
              div html element, use flex box instead or grid for automatic/
              fluid margin between filter buttons when the screen is small
            - bonus what does a "My Checkouts" page contains in the context
              of library web app
          
  - make the admin/librarian side

### General TODO
- make sure the book service works properly, ensure data sanitization
- prevent upload cover image abuse (upload the image at the same time as clicking update book data)
- make the html homepage that display all books (search up responsive design)
- at user routes, create new user is only for admin access
- make two different endpoints, one for admin/librarian, the other for client/patron/user
  - New Endpoint to get single user by their id (admin/librarian only)
  - New Endpoint to update a user by their id (admin/librarian only)

- make the correct flow for cancelling a reservation
  1. user is on my reservation page
  2. on each reservation there will be a button that
     when pressed, will send the reservation id to the api

- make the correct modify reservation flow
  1. user is on my reservation page
  2. user click on a reservation, redirect to individual reservation page
  3. there is a button to modify it
  4. after modifying things, there is a send button, click and it sends the data to the api

- add a search bar for checkout history and reservation history

- pagination and or limit data fetching on checkout history and reservation history
  so it does not load every single data immidiately

- check whether the jwt token is expired or not
- implement refresh tokens and expiration checking for main auth jwt_token (1 hour expiration time)
  - refresh tokens last for a long time, like 1 week or 1 month

this app will have two sides, one for patron (book enjoyer) and one for librarians (book manager)
- patron can only make reservation to borrow books, see their profile, and see all books, search books with ui
- librarian can add books, see all books, see all patrons, see all borrowed books, see all reservations, see all fines, see all reports, manage borrowing

- checkouts is for librarian
- reservations is for user (only some of it, other endpoints is for admin/librarian)

- rate limiting on apis
- on homepage script, when the it loads and randomly picks five books, 
  limit into only picking at most 100 books for performance reason while
  maintining randomness. bonus points if it is possible to do this whole
  randomize seaching thing directly with sequilize. 

- maybe make a built in pop up so it works on mobile 
  that will replace every alert pop up. also able to be
  used for confirmation prompt thing.

- more on home page like books based on author
  books based in letters
  idk ask gpt for books based on what that make sense

- code cleanup, 
  - delete unused/test pages
  - css cleanup, no duplicate style
  - js cleanup, no duplicate code
  - delete any console.log/console.error on front end
  - move custom pop up (inside myReservation html and js)
    into its own file so it is reuseable accross the whole app
    - change alert or prompt to custom pop up


- try changing the return http code error on controllers
  into customError() instead.

- auth middleware redirect to login page instead?

- fix margin/gap between text and things inside reservation card on myreservations page

- on homepage top bar part thing, collapse it in mobile
